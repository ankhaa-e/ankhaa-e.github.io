        <p class="project-bio">Tetris was a recreation of the classic video game
          created by Alexey Pajitnov. It was the final project done for the class
          COMP_SCI 211: Fundamentals of Computer Programming II. It was created
          in a team of 2 over the span of a week and a half.  Tetris was created
          in CLion using C++ and object-oriented programming. In the final version, points
          can be scored by clearing full lines and the game plays until the top
          line is reached. Score and the number of lines is tracked. Where the
          falling tetrimino will land is shown at the bottom as well as the next
          tetrimino.
