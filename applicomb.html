          The Applicomb was a project for the class Design Thinking and Communication.
          It was a quarter long project in a team of four to create an applicator
          of a new dandruff treatment created by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a practicing physician at
          Northwestern University’s Ann & Robert H. Lurie Hospital of Chicago.
          The challenge was that the treatment was highly viscous and would get stuck
          in the hair, hence the need for an applicator. The final design was reached
          through testing with droppers,interviews with dermatologists and material
          science experts, and surveying test subjects of the treatment.
          The entire process revolved around Human-Centered Design, involving
          feedback from users at every step to create the next iteration.
          Due to the class being in a virtual setting, we were unable to create any
          physical prototypes, however I was able to create CAD drawings of the product
          in SolidWorks. The final report is available to view.
